# Exploring Upward Mobility in America

### Project Summary

Economic and social opportunities are essential to socio-economic mobility across the United States. Various determinants of mobility, such as education, income, incarceration, and housing costs vary widely across the nation. Research done by Raj Chetty, et. al and other scholars indicates that the place you grow up can play a huge role in how these mobility opportunities surface and play out in in adulthood. The research suggest that some areas have higher mobility opportunities than others, and further, that it may be possible to produce better outcomes for individuals by relocating them to areas which are richer in opportunity.

This project builds off of that research by exploring how certain socio-economic measures like those listed above vary across the nation and within smaller regions. Further, the project looks to identify and explore key "Mobility Hotspots" - areas which may be rich in mobility opportunities. Below, you can find additional guiding questions to help you through the project.

 + How do various mobility outcomes vary by the financial and racial background an individual comes from? In particular, how do the following vary: male incarceration rates, income levels, education levels, & socio-economic mobility opportunities?

 + How do an individual's socio-economic mobility opportunities vary with various geographic characteristics. For instance, how are mobility opportunities related to an area's cost-of-living & an area's economic growth?

 + Are there particular regions or cities that offer promising mobility opportunities such as higher incomes and education levels, while maintaining low barriers to entry? If so, what characterizes these regions? Where do they exist geographically?
